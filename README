Things to note on logfile: 

Logfile does not get any extensions added to it (.txt, .csv, etc.). It just creates a basic file with the name that was given by the user
If you do not include a logfile name, it will create and write to the file name: 'logfile'

Additional mentions: 

In this project, I realized the children were not terminating as close to the termination time as they should have (same for the last project). That is fixed now :)

Everything else should work as expected.

How to run project: 

To know how to run the project, run this command: 
./oss -h 

If you want to skip the sick, cool, awesome, fun, wordy, informative, help command above, run this command below: 
./oss -s # -n # -t # -f 'string'      <-(# - any integer | 'string' - any name you want for the log file) (These could be arranged in any order)

What was done this project (notes for me):
1) created a project that uses message queues to send to the children in worker 
2) the message queue sent a random second (within the interval of the users input for -t) and a random nanosecond
3) worker processed what was in the message queue and deleted it as it was used for the childrens termination time
4) In addition to this project, a 4th command has been introduced: a logfile 
5) The user will name the log file and the process table from oss.c will be written to it as well as printed on the screen
